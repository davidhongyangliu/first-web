# first web system
Hello, thanks for visiting. 
Html, css, javascript, php, ajax, mySQL are used in this project.The elements of the pages are arranged in the grid layout.The search is realised by javascript (also I realised it by php and database),  Please feel free to try the interesting filtering, searching, displaying of the products. Ajax and php is used to enrich the functions, however apache or other server side software is needed to run it. cart and sign in function are not finished yet due to time schedule, but the whole structure is alrealdy constructed.
